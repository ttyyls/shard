this is still in a REALLY REALLY early stage, like not even usable  
if ye like this concept then PLEASE help out  
I cant do it all by myself.. :/

for **contibuting** check out #2 for the todo list  

# Concept
- keeps the overall feel and spirit of asm with some additional higher level syntax and features 
- jump anywhere, anytime. Making spaghetti code easier than ever
- keep types in your head. Add an integer to a pointer? yupp, no problem. Dereference a float? sure, why not
- a simple std lib for abstracting away the tediousness
- DENSE operator oriented syntax (or "operator soup" for fans and lovers)

# Disclaimers
- This lang isn't meant to be used for serious projects, it's primarly hobby and fun
- there's gonna be drastic changes throughout the development process
- It's awfuly unsafe, there's nothing stopping you from doing stupid shit
- it's not cross platform, merely cross-compatible. So you can write code for any platform, but not compile the same one for multiple.

# Code Examples

## Hello World
```
@main
$puts "Hello World"
&ext 0
```

## Fibonacci
```
.ent main

#main
$puts <- !fib 9
&ext 0

@fib n -> msg {
    (n < 1) => ret "Invalid Number of Terms!"
    (n = 1) => ret "0"
    (n = 2) => ret "0 1"

    %arg1 2 = 1
    %arg2 2 = 0

    #loop
    ;temp = (arg1 + arg2)

    'arg2 : arg1
    'arg1 : temp

    $printf "%d\n", temp 
    'n --
    (n > 0) => ~loop

    ret "Done!"
}
```
